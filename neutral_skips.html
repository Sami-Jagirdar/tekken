                Neutral Skip Definition & Notes
            </summary>
            <div class="notes-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I define neutral skips as moves that allow characters to easily initiate offense when both opponents are at range 2.4 or more and the frame advantage for one player is in the range of [-3,3]. 
                        <br>
                        It is difficult to make these moves whiff with movement options such as backdash and/or sidestep/sidewalk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some common types are 
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Safe long range mid that forces a mixup on block or gives high reward on hit/CH
                                <br>
                                (even if it's "linear", mistiming a sidestep could mean getting clipped)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Long range homing high that is +ob (or close to 0) and high reward on hit/CH
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Certain "small" pokes that have expanded hitboxes and realigning followups that cannot be stepped (many examples, but I've only included some)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Just because some character might not appear here or has less moves doesn't mean they aren't braindead. Most characters have buttons which are basically super moves despite not having the range of the moves in this list (eg: Jun barrier parry +2 on block, basically safe on whiff)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some moves may not seem that bad in a vacuum, but I tried to consider the character's overall toolkit to justify the move's inclusion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some of the minor moves probably don't even need to be on here, while other minor moves should probably be major
                    </li>
                </ul>
